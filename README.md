# Trie-Data-Structures-For-String-Manipulation-And-Searching-With-Prefix-And-Suffix
 This project implements a 26-way Trie data structure to manage strings efficiently.Then inserts all words to the trie from the given txt file. 
Searches an argument in the trie,prints all strings start with given prefix in the trie, lexicographically, prints all strings end with given
suffix in your trie, lexicographically , prints all strings start with given prefix and end with given suffix in the trie, lexicographically
and  prints top k words that have most occurrences,in the trie. 
This project uses Command Line Interface(CLI)
It uses Singly Linked List Data Structure in order to find full auto complete.
It also uses Linear Probing Hashing and priority queue to find the most frequently occurring strings in the Trie.
